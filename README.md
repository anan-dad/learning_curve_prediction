# Learning curve prediction

Predict learning curves of CNN performance on CIFAR10 dataset as a project in University of Freiburg.

# Dataset and paper

Dataset are 256 configurations of 5 different hyperparameters of a 3-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) and trained each of them for 40 epochs on the CIFAR10.
